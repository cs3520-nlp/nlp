It's been a while since I've gotten a massage due to my work schedule and my bf has gotten more massages than I have in the last month so i told him "we're going"!
I saw this place on yelp with good reviews and recommendations on therapists availability and their specialty.
Plus I didn't know we can pick our own so that was a plus.
Parking/entry was a little bit confusing for entrance since it's either street/limited back parking. 
Entrance was also in the back.
Ambiance is small but cozy, something I like, water and selection of tea are available and there are magazines for the wait if you go in early. 
Receptionist is nice and friendly.
I tried the relaxation with hot stones and did tell my Miriam my problem areas and she focused on them. 
She was also very considerate of how I am doing and gradually eased me to be less tense. 
It didnt feel  rushed at all. I actually fell asleep and was woken up with my own heavy breathing.  
That's how great she was! 
I will be coming back.
I tried cupping for the first time. 
Britni explained everything about it, what the discoloration means, what cupping does and initially I wanted to say stop because it was a bit painful but once all the cup were positioned, my body just kind of said "let it be"!
I was a little hesitant about increased nights rest after cupping so I decided to wait until the day after to see how I feel and she was right! 
I'm usually up early but today I actually slept in until 9! 
Overall, it was fantastic! 
The only thing is I didnt like that there is a separate transaction for each service added so a total of 4 for me.
