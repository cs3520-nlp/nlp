I needed to find a cleaners who could clean and preserve our daughter's wedding dress recently. 
Based on reviews, I decided to try Hamilton. 
They explained their process carefully and checked the dress for tears, dirt, when I brought it in, and gave me a price and said it would take about 2 weeks.
When I picked it up, it was nicely boxed and the price was slightly less than I  anticipated.
We also brought our new son-in-laws wedding suit in along with my husbands, for cleaning. 
When I picked up those suits, there was a folded up piece of paper inside a plastic baggie, attached to our SIL's suit. 
The owner told us it was found in the suit pocket and they thought we should have it.
I opened it and discovered it was his wedding vows written on that slightly crumpled paper!
Wow! 
Attention to detail and thoughtfulness at the dry cleaners?
This place has it!
Thank you!
