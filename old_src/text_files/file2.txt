As a senior single woman needing help with a faucet leak and not knowing a thing about plumbing (nor being able to afford a plumber). 
I was told NIAGARA Plumbing in Garden Grove was the place for help. 
I drove an hour to get there. 
They were amazingly kind, patient, totally knowledgable and even on the spot fixed a part I had been able to remove that was not working. 
Brian spent over an hour macgyvering something for me that I could install myself WHO DOES THAT? 
I have never had such thoughtful help evenmore appreciated in light of having called several other plumbing parts places in south OC where I live. 
No one would bother with me, they simply said hire a plumber and replace the whole thing.
NIAGARA, Brian & the crew there - fabulous men, amazing human beings, consumate professionals!
