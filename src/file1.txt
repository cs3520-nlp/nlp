My wife and I bought $1500 of items and bought a sink that had been on the floor for a long time. 
We asked if we could buy it to see if it would fit.
The sink did not fit and we called Jose who was our sales guy 2 days later and said we had to return it cause it did not fit.
We returned to return the sink and Brian said we could get store credit only. 
We were told that there were no returns on the special orders we bought. 
I am glad my wife was not there or she would have blown a gasket. 
After saying that was not what our sales guy had implied he proceeded to point out the sign by the door that said no returns.  
After expressing my unhappiness Brian who was rude and not understanding said we could get a refund but it would cost us a 15% restocking fee. 
It was only $21 and not the point. I told him if that was the only way, then I would never come in the store again.
Some people!  
I know Joe the owner would have let us and blown a gasket as to how we were treated.
