I am extremely upset about this place. 
I visited three times before writing this review. 
I feel scammed. 
The first two times the female owner seemed to be rude and condescending. 
I asked simply what clothes would be better dry cleaned or laundered. 
She said, "your husband wants dry cleaning", you do that. 
A conversation she never had with my husband. 
I ended up getting the clothes done. 
I went back and two of the clothes had marks that were worse then what we dropped off. 
Then the pricing afterwards was significantly higher than what she quoted beforehand. 
She insisted I pay, would not go over pricing. 
She was stating she has somewhere to be and she will talk to me next time. 
I paid her. 
She still insisted she break it down for me. 
She started to do the math out loud, couldn't make the numbers add up, became frazzled, went to the back where she took a calculator and after 5 minutes came back and the numbers added up. 
The pricing was actually about $2-3 more per outfit, as in my bill was about $30 more.
I went to this place a few times because my husband liked the collar stays they put in. 
However after the disgusting attitude of the owner, pushiness, and dishonesty I will never go back again.
Keep in mind the reviews here are also sponsored by the Starbucks gift card the owner hands out to get good reviews.
