Contributions:


* Research
    * Originally did research into finding python libraries that would convert
      language into first order logic, as well as sentiment analysis using the
      VADER module from the NLTK library. This route was ultimately abandonded
      as some of the libraries I found to convert text (and grammars) to first
      order logic were buggy and/or abandonded.


* Presentation
    * Prepared and presented the project demonstration, added text descriptions
      to the ipython notebook to

* Code
    * Implemented the management and saving (to disk) of trained models and preprocessed
      data via pickling. This allowed just 1 person with a fast machine (me) to
      run all the training, and other team members can just load the pretrained model directly,
      and start interacting with the models immediately.
        * All saved models/preprocessed data can be found in the pickled directory.
    * Created notebook files to do experimentation on Topic Modeling.
        * See topic_modeling_75.ipynb and topic_modeling300.ipynb (75 and 300 topics generateted
          respectively)
    * git commits:
        * too many commits to list, see https://github.com/cs3520-nlp/nlp/commits/master for
          a list of commits made by the group.
    * also did minor debugging and fixes, as well as resovling merge conflicts, and helped with
      some git related tasks.

* Experimentation and Analysis
    * Experimented with Topic Modeling, ran the LDA model with multiple input paramaters
      to find a set of paramters that provided good results. (300 topics with lambda value of .4
      works very well, see the report)
    * Worked on the Topic Modeling portion of the Experimentation and Analysis portion
      of the report.
