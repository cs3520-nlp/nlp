In this project, I worked on the proposal slides along with my teammembers and I presented the proposal during class session. Then, as for the coding portion of this project, I made some commits to the old_src folder. I initially wrote sentTopic.py, topicModel.py, and supplied the text files for those Python programs. However, based on further inspection, my group decided that it was best to pursue newer and more robust ideas for our final demo. Therefore, most of the code that I had written was not used for the final version of our project which we presented in class. As for the report, I contributed to the Abstract, the Background, and I fleshed out some details with regards to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
